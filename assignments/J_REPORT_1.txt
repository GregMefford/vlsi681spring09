RESOURCES AND PLANNING 
SECTION 1: RESOURCES.
a. List all personnel and skills of each (VHDL or Altera experience, hardware or software project experience, good writing skills, etc.)
Greg:

Megan:

Sandeep:

b. List the number of hours each team member has available to devote to the project over the quarter (8 hours per week is probably a minimum) 
Greg: 8
Megan: 8
Sandeep: 8
c. List all hardware and software resources that will be used for development. Include any computers owned by the team members as well as the hardware and software in 890 Rhodes.

SECTION 2: PLANNING.
a. List who will be assigned to oversee each of the following:
Documentation - Megan
Testing - Sandeep
Version control and backups -Greg
Tracking and productivity - Greg

b. Describe how the team members will communicate, including meetings, email, phone, etc., and how they will coordinate their work.
Class MWF
Email:
Greg - gregory.mefford@gmail.com
Megan - mmswim22@gmail.com
Sandeep - gsandyreddy@gmail.com

Phone:
Greg - 513-673-1912
Megan - 
Sandeep - 

c. Give the time and place of weekly team meetings (at least one meeting per week is required).
Tentatively, we will plan on meeting Wednesdays after class in/outside the classroom until we can come up with a more permanent time and place.

d. Describe completely how you will handle version control and backups.
Version control: git
<Greg to describe git in more detail>

Backups: git + github + Dropbox
<Greg to describe the backup scheme in more detail>

e. Describe your plan for testing.  Altera does not support testbenches, only .vec files.  How will you document your testing? 
<Sandeep will write this section (Greg and Megan can help too)>

f. Provide both a Gantt chart and Tracking Document for your project.  You will need to update the tracking document each week and include the updated documents in your project report.
<Megan to create Gantt Chart>
<Greg to create Tracking Document>

g. Describe the coding and documentation standards you will use.
<To be determined together, probably based on someone else's standards>

h. Describe how you will produce up-to-date documentation (content and form—online?) in parallel with the project.  You will need to produce supporting documents, including a user manual, along with code documentation.
<To be determined together, probably based on someone else's standards>

SECTION 3: HARDWARE BASICS
a. Describe the board you will be using, including:
      chip capability, including gate count, clock speed, memory, etc.

      I/O devices 

b. Describe the capabilities of other chips which you can simulate using the design tools provided (in the event that the chip you have will not support dual-core processing)

c. Describe the information you can obtain from the design tools about gate usage, speed, power, layout, etc. which will be needed to analyze the performance of your processor.

d. Explain the procedure you will use for testing a hardware module with the given tools and documenting your test results.

e. Perform the following simple experiments and report the results:
1. What is the length of a critical path between two flip-flops? Does this depend on the placement of the flip-flops? Do "glitches" occur in the simulation? In the circuit? Are these significant?

2. Design a D flip-flop starting from the gate level. Compare its behavior with the D flip-flop in the Altera VHDL library. Can you vary the clocking strategy—rising-edge, falling-edge, level triggered? Is one strategy preferable for this hardware?

3. Repeat problem 2 for a 4-bit adder.

4. Can you detect changes in a simple gate's switching behavior which depend on its fan-out?
