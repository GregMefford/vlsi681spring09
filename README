To get started working on the project, you will probably want to set up a few options for using git on your system.
Here are some commands that will set some common options for you:
(Obviously, you will want to change some of these to reflect your information)

git config --global user.name 'Greg Mefford'
git config --global user.email 'gregory.mefford@gmail.com'

There are tons of other options that you can also set.
Try searching the Internet for .gitconfig to see some other people's examples.
